Ideas and Tips for using Github Features in Fisheries Projects




## Documentation / Communication / Collaboration

Github has 3 features that help with documenting your work, coordinating among contributors, and communicating
with people who use the resulting data/code/outputs:
* issue threads
* readme files
* wiki pages

With a bit of creative adaptation, you can use a combination of these 3 features to do a whole lot of stuff.
Below are some suggestions.


### Issues

The basic idea of the issue threads is to open 1 issue for each bug/task, then discuss it with others, and close it when it's done (like [this](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Githubbing/issues/11)).

### Readme files

* into subfolders (E.g.


### Wiki Pages




## Housekeeping
